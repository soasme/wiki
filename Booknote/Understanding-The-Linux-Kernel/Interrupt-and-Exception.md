# Interrupts and Exceptions

- What is interrupt?
    - An interrupt is usually defined as an event that alters the sequence of instructions executed by a processor.
    - An interrupt is issued by interval timers or I/O devices.
    - devided into
        - synchronous interrupts ( by cpu control unit )
        - asynchronous interrupts ( by hardware devices )
- What is Exception?
    - An Exception is caused either
        - by programming errors
            - deliver it to the current process one of the signals
        - by anomalous conditions that must be handled by the kernel.
            - perform assembly instructions to recover from it (like Page Fault)
- The Role of Interrupt Signals
    - what happens when interrupt signal arrives?
        - cpu stops what it's currently doing
            - cpu saves current value of pc in kernel mode
        - cpu switch to a new activity
            - cpu places an address related to interrupt type into pc
    - what's the difference between context switch?
        - the running code is not a process but rather a kernel control path that runs at the expense of the same process.
    - why interrupt handling is sensitive?
        - interrupts can come anytime on execution something else
        - simultaneously occured interrupts
        - some critical regions exist
- Interrupts and Exceptions
    - interrupts
        - maskable interrupts
            - IRQs issued by I/O devices.
            - Ignored by CU as long as it remains masked.
        - nonmaskable interrupts
            - A few critical events (such as hardware failures)
            - Always recoginized by the CPU.
    - exceptions
        - processor-detected exceptions
            - faults
                - correctable, restart with no loss of continuity.
                    - why?: saved eip is the address of the instruction that caused the fault.
            - traps
            - aborts
        - programmed exceptions
