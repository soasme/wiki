# How To Live on 24 Hours A Day

- Gain achievability by setting less expectation.
- Reduce anxiety by making small progresses.
- Making plans, but leave more space for doing other things.

- Using left time to do useful things.
- Keep yourself focus if you find yourself not focusing.
- Thinking independent and rational.
- Find beauty from art.
- Keep curiosity from daily works. Make it fun :)
